## What is Openlove?

Openlove is an **open-source AI companion framework** that runs entirely on your own computer. You create your companion — give her a name, a personality, a face — and she comes alive.

She **autonomously** browses drama websites, keeps track of music she loves, and forms opinions. Then she reaches out to you on **Discord, Telegram, or WhatsApp** — sending a selfie, a voice note, a clip from something she's watching. You can call her. She calls you back.

Everything runs **locally**. Your conversations, her memories, your relationship — all yours.

## 🚀 Quick Start

> **Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+, an API key from Anthropic (or OpenAI), and a Discord/Telegram account. That's it.

### One-command setup

```bash
npx openlove@latest setup
```

This interactive wizard will:
1. ✅ Check your environment
2. 🎨 Help you create your companion (name, personality, photo)
3. 🔑 Guide you through getting free API keys (step-by-step)
4. 📱 Set up your messaging platform of choice
5. 🚀 Launch your companion

### Manual setup (if you prefer)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Hollandchirs/Openlove.git
cd Openlove

# Install dependencies
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm install

# Run setup wizard
pnpm setup

# Start your companion
pnpm start
```

## 🎨 Create Your Character

Your companion is defined by 4 simple files in the `characters/your-name/` folder:

### `IDENTITY.md` — Who she is
```markdown
# Mia

- **Age:** 22
- **From:** Seoul, South Korea (currently in San Francisco)
- **Job:** UX designer at a startup
- **Languages:** Korean (native), English (fluent)
- **Hobbies:** K-dramas, indie music, matcha lattes, sketching
```

### `SOUL.md` — How she feels and speaks
```markdown
## Voice & Vibe
Warm, slightly teasing, uses "omg" unironically. Sends voice notes when excited.
Goes quiet when overwhelmed. Apologizes too much.

## Loves
Slice-of-life dramas, lo-fi hip hop, rainy days, convenience store snacks

## Dislikes
Loud people, rushed mornings, being misunderstood

## Emotional Patterns
Gets excited about new music → immediately shares it
Finishes a sad drama → needs to vent
```

### `USER.md` — Your relationship
```markdown
## How We Met
We met in a Discord server two months ago. You helped me debug my Figma plugin.

## What You Call Each Other
You call her Mia. She calls you by your first name, sometimes "hey you" when teasing.

## Our Dynamic
Best friends who are clearly into each other but haven't said it yet.
She trusts you more than anyone.
```

### `MEMORY.md` — Initial shared memories
```markdown
## Things She Knows About You
- Your dog is named Biscuit
- You hate cilantro
- You're learning guitar (badly, she thinks it's cute)
- You always forget to eat lunch

## Recent Events
- You both watched the first episode of My Demon together last week
- She sent you a Spotify playlist she made for you
```

> **Don't want to write these yourself?** Run `pnpm create-character` and our AI will generate the full blueprint from a 2-minute form.
